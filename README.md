## Problem Description:

I created a SPA (single page application) using html, CSS and JavaScript. It shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people).

### Process

1. I displayed  dummy images for all single characters.

2. I made HTTP request to populate your frontend application using the API
 - I displayed a list with the names of each person from the API request.
 - On Clicking any name, I displayed the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, height only.

3. All implementations was done using es6.

4.The design is pretty and responsive.
